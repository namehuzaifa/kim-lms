<h1>About Zef Neary</h1>	
<p>Neary Coaching was founded in 2022 by Zef Neary. Zef has a long history of working in high-stress and high-stakes careers, including Nuclear Missiles and Federal Auditing. He realized that many of the challenges and setbacks he faced were due to the negative stories he told himself. Through life coaching, he learned how to master his thoughts to defeat the overwhelm, frustration, and anxiety that threatened to derail him. He decided to use his knowledge and experience to help small business owners (and their employees) identify and overcome these same self-imposed limitations.
